# AGENTS.md — orientation for coding agents

Read this before editing. It tells you what this project is, the one rule that
matters, and exactly where things live.

## What this is

A single-file, auto-playing 16:9 HTML slide deck shown on trade-fair TVs for
Uploadcare. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — **no framework, no bundler, no npm.** The only
tooling is a Python build step (`build.py`) that inlines assets. Keep it that
way unless explicitly asked otherwise.

## The one rule

**Edit `src/index.template.html` and `assets/`. Never hand-edit
`dist/uploadcare-show.html`** — it is generated. After any change run:

```bash
python build.py
```

`dist/uploadcare-show.html` is the artifact that goes on the TV. If you edit it
directly, your changes are lost on the next build and the source drifts out of
sync.

The template contains six placeholder tokens that `build.py` fills:
`/*__COMMIT_MONO__*/`, `/*__INTER_VAR__*/`, `/*__JB_MONO__*/`, `__LOGO_SVG__`,
`__GLOBE_SVG__`, `__ASSETS_JSON__`. Don't remove or rename them.

## Verify your work

There is no test suite; verify visually. If a headless browser is available
(e.g. Playwright), load `dist/uploadcare-show.html`, call `enter(n)` in the page
to jump to slide *n*, wait, and screenshot. Otherwise open it in a browser and
check the slide you touched. Also confirm `document.fonts.check("18px 'Commit
Mono'")` is `true` and the console is clean.

## Architecture in one breath

A `deck` object (`{ settings, slides:[…] }`) drives everything. Each slide has a
`type`; a renderer in the `R` map turns it into DOM; `enter(i)` activates a slide
and kicks off its animations; the editor panel reads/writes the same `deck` and
re-renders live. Slides are pure data — copy, order, durations, and per-slide
options are just fields. Assets (photos/logo/globe/fonts) are the only things
that require a rebuild.

## Where things live in `src/index.template.html`

CSS (in `<style>`):
- L37  `#stage` — the fixed 1920×1080 stage that scales to any screen
- L85–155 per-slide-type styles (`statement`, `number`, `chart`, `stats`, logo)
- L157 `HERO BOARD SLIDE` — globe, floating `.hb-node`s, `.hb-meta` terminal text
- L242 `EDITOR` — the slide-out control panel

JS (in the last `<script>`):
- L430 `DEFAULT_DECK` — the shipped deck; edit here to change default content
- L471 stage scaling (`fit()`)
- L483 `R = { … }` — **the renderers**, one function per slide type
- L608 `fitText()` — auto-shrinks oversized headlines to fit
- L636 `buildChart()` — the self-drawing line chart
- L676 `animateLogo()` — the six logo choreographies (`switch(variant)`)
- L832 `BOARD_META` — the terminal readout content for the file board
- L918 `setupBoard()` — globe spin, photo float, and typewriter wiring
- `enter()` — slide activation + animation dispatch (add new types here)
- `applyTextFx()` / `wrapWords()` (just after `multiline()`) — the shared
  "Text animation" system (rise/blur/weight/stagger). Runs once per slide
  inside `renderDeck()`, driven by each slide's `textFx` field. `fx-weight`
  needs the Inter Variable font; `fx-stagger` word-wraps plain-text
  `.reveal` elements only (skips structural containers automatically).
- editor: `TYPE_LABEL`, `slideTitle()`, `TEXT_FX_LABEL`/`textFxFieldHTML()`,
  `fieldsFor()` (per-type controls — every case gets the shared text-fx
  control for free via the `dur` prefix), the `NEW` templates, and the
  add-slide menu

## Common tasks

**Change default copy / numbers / order:** edit `DEFAULT_DECK` (L430). No asset
change → still run `build.py` to refresh `dist/`.

**Add a new slide type:** (1) add a renderer to `R`; (2) add its CSS; (3) if it
animates, dispatch it in `enter()`; (4) register it in `TYPE_LABEL`,
`slideTitle()`, `fieldsFor()`, the `NEW` templates, and the add-slide menu so the
editor supports it. Follow `board`/`logoAnim` as the fullest examples.

**Swap a photo:** replace `assets/photos/<name>.png` (keep the filename) and
rebuild. Sizing/quality knobs: `PHOTO_SPEC` and `JPEG_QUALITY` in `build.py`.
Photo keys used by the board: `tennis`, `blonde` (portrait.png), `car`, `docx`.

**New logo / globe:** replace the SVG under `assets/brand/` and rebuild. The logo
is made responsive by `prepare_logo()` in `build.py` (it strips the fixed
width/height so CSS controls size). If your SVG differs structurally, check that
still works.

**Tune motion:** float animation lives in the `.hb-node.float …` CSS + the
`fdur`/`--fdelay` setup in `setupBoard()`; the typewriter is `typeMeta()` /
`BOARD_META`; the logo animations are in `animateLogo()`.

## Conventions & gotchas

- Brand palette: bg `#090909`, mark yellow `#FFCF3E`, status green `#008B4B`
  (`--ok`), terminal grey `#8E8E8E`, footer grey `#595959`. Use the CSS vars.
- Fonts: Inter Variable (display, `--sans`), JetBrains Mono (`--mono`), Commit
  Mono (`--cmono`, terminal). All three are embedded as base64 woff2 (see
  `encode_fonts`/`encode_variable_font`/`encode_jbmono` in `build.py`), so
  everything works fully offline — don't replace any of them with a bare CDN
  link. Inter is embedded as a single ranged (`100 900`) variable font on
  purpose: it's what lets the "weight morph" text animation (see
  `TEXT_FX_LABEL`) interpolate `font-weight` smoothly instead of snapping
  between static instances.
- Everything is positioned inside the 1920×1080 stage; use px within that frame,
  not viewport units. The stage handles scaling to the TV.
- Respect `REDUCED` (prefers-reduced-motion): new animations should no-op or
  render instantly when it's set, like the existing ones.
- No `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` and no external runtime requests — the deck
  must run fully offline from the single file.
- Keep it dependency-free at run time. Pillow is build-time only.
