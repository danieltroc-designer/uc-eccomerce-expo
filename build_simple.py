"""
Build the *simplified* Uploadcare TV show (the 7-card booth loop).

Standalone from build.py so the main deck is never touched: this reads
src/simple.template.html, inlines the same assets (reusing build.py's
encoders) plus the booth QR, and writes a separate self-contained file to
dist/uploadcare-simple.html.

Usage:
    python build_simple.py            # writes dist/uploadcare-simple.html
    python build_simple.py --watch    # rebuild on any change under src/ or assets/

To change where the booth QR sends people, replace assets/qr/booth-qr.png and
rebuild — the build decodes it and prints the destination.
